# WAYLAND EDITION
this experimental branch uses wayland instead of X11 using GNOME as its desktop environment until budgie 11 comes out with their own wayland implementation.

## wtf is this?
this is a script designed to install all of my applications and dependencies, as well as configure some system settings (not all unfortunately) to get everything up and running.

## how to use the script?
the script is designed to be run after you finish installing arch linux from ISO or any removable boot medium (manually or via `archinstall`).
it is also recommended to run the script within the sudo session limit to fully automate the process, though you may also run it without it 
(not recommended, as you will need to enter in your password a few times, defeating the purpose of an automated script, but should be fine regardless).

## prerequisites.
the only prerequisite package you need is `wget` to download the script.
```
sudo pacman -S wget
```
this will also start (or refresh) the sudo session, which lasts for 5 minutes by default.

## run teh script.
quickly download the latest script, make it executable, and run it.
```
wget https://github.com/SimpleBrian/post-install/raw/wayland/simplebrian.sh
chmod +x simplebrian.sh
./simplebrian.sh
```
do note that you cannot run the script directly with sudo, or as root, because the `makepkg` command to build and install `paru` will refuse to work in a root environment.
this is a security measure the script works around by taking advantage of the sudo session created earlier to make prolific use of the sudo command, while also allowing `makepkg`
to run in a non-root enviroment to install `paru` with.
